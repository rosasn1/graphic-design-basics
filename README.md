# Graphics Design Concepts Repository

This repository contains a collection of small graphics programs demonstrating fundamental computer graphics and graphic design concepts. Each folder represents a self-contained example built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**, primarily leveraging WebGL-style utilities.

All projects in this repository were created by me during my **junior year of college** as part of coursework and personal experimentation with computer graphics.

## ⚠️ Required: `Common` Folder

The **`Common`** folder is a **required dependency** for every project in this repository.

It contains shared JavaScript utilities that are used by **all programs** in the other folders:

- `geometry.js` – Geometry-related helper functions
- `initShaders.js` – Shader compilation and initialization logic
- `MV.js` – Matrix and vector math utilities

> **Important:**  
> None of the examples in this repository will run correctly without the files in the `Common` folder present and properly linked.

---

## Project Template

Each project folder typically follows this structure:


- The **HTML file** initializes the canvas and loads required scripts
- The **JavaScript file** contains the rendering logic, shaders, and interaction (if applicable)

---

## ⭐ Final Project (Most Important)

**Folder:** `Final Project/`

This folder contains the **most important and comprehensive project** in the repository. It represents the culmination of the concepts explored throughout the earlier examples, combining multiple graphics techniques into a single, more complete application.

> If you are only exploring one project from this repository, start here.

## Running the Projects

1. Ensure the `Common` folder is present at the root level
2. Open any `.html` file using:
   - A local web server (recommended), or
   - A browser that allows local file access
3. No additional build steps are required

---

## Notes

- These projects are educational and exploratory in nature
- Code style and structure reflect incremental learning over time
- Each folder is intentionally independent for ease of testing and reuse
